This is my fork of the Linux kernel.  Here is a list of the changes:

--Added custom version suffix "-echelon" to indicate that this is a patched
  fork by echelonxray in kernel builds and added this text to this README.
--Added RISC-V No M-extension support.  Added new config symbol RISCV_ISA_M
  to control this.

I intend to keep this fork up to date with the upstream vanilla kernel.
The master branch contains my patched kernel.  The vanilla branch tracks
the upstream kernel 1-to-1.  You can generate a diff of the differences by
simply running "git diff vanilla..master".  The idea is to keep the kernel
version tags intact and correct for what I think would be a close
approximation of the the upstream kernel had my changes been accepted.

Why a fork and not submitted upstream?:
Simple.  The kernel maintainers refused some of the features that I wanted.
I tried to submit patches upstream.  However, the kernel maintainers did
not want to maintain the features that I sent.  I can understand them not
wanting to support every person's pet projects, but I need those changes
for my projects.  So I will maintain this fork with those patches applied.
If you need some of these features, feel free to use this fork.  It should
track very closely to the upstream vanilla kernel.  I will continue to try
to submit future changes upstream first.  If they are rejected, they will
probably end up in this fork.

Below is the vanilla kernel README text:

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
